# TeLo - TEmperature LOgger
This is a project I completed with the purpose of tracking the temperature inside a greenhouse for the paste day or so. It uses a e-ink display and an esp8266 microcontoller and has a projected 2 year battery capacity on a single charge.

Here is the temperature logger in action:

It is showing the temperature (black line) and the humidity (red line) for the past 48 hours. From the data displayed in the picture we can tell that it was sunny today, with a max temp of 38C. Yesterday the max temp only reached about 28C, suggesting that it was a cloudy day. The temperature during the night was around 16C.

## Hardware
This is what the hardware looks like:

It has a 3d printed case, 2.8' e-ink display, 2800 mAh battery and an esp8266 microcontroller.

## Schematic
This is the schematic I used to solder everything together.
